Overall, total revenue, AOV, and gross profit were each below their typical range, while gross profit and the gross profit margin were within their typical range, implying an increase in profitability. Indeed, net profit (the bottom line) increased nearly 15% YoY, up from $20,300 to $424,250.

As for turnover, on avg we collected our debt every five days, we paid our debt once per day, and it took 144 days to turn our inventory, which is about 1.5 times longer than the goal of 90 days.

Moving on to liquidity ratios, which show how effectively assets cover liabilities, our debt ratio was near zero, which means we had much more in assets than in liabilities. This was supported by our high current ratio of ~24, which shows us that for each dollar in liabilities we had $24 in assets. Finally, to turn our inventory and resources into cash it took 150 days, which has been about the same for the last year.
