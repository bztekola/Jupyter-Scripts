This recurring quarterly and monthly project generates a financial summary from QuickBooks data. It also generates data and many charts which are hand-copied into a Keynote presentation to be shown at the monthly Team Leads meeting.

The QuickBooks data is taken from the "Profit and Loss Detail" QuickBooks report, begins on Jan 2014, and ends on whatever month the report will end on.
