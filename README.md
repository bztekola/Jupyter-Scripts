This repo contains all of my Adafruit python scripts and any docs which they generate. It's organized like this: 

-> department  
-> type_of_project  
-> project_name  
-> project_subfolders  
-> project_elements

You can see all of the .py scripts which contain Python and R functions I use frequently, along with all the data pulls for shipping, fab, and part data. Go to Fake_Folder_Copy > Python/R_Libraries.
