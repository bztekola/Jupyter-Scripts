Similar search keywords are assigned a "top word", so "Feather", "Feather M0", "Feather M4", etc. fall under the top word of "Feather", while "Raspberry Pi", "Raspberry", "Rasberry", etc. fall under "Raspberry Pi", and so on.

To determine these top words, we generate pairs of part category names (from our database) and search keywords, and rate the similarity in each pair using a method called the Jaccard Index. For each search keyword, the part category which forms the highest scoring pair becomes that keywords "top word".

For some examples, see the tables to the right.
