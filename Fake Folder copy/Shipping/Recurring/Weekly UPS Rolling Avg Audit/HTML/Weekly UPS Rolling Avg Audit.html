<!-- PURPOSE -->

	<h2> Purpose </h2>
	<p>This weekly report monitors the UPS gross transportation charge, as well as the average cost per UPS package. The gross transportation charge is a value that determines the level of savings which UPS offers to Adafruit, so any changes in this value will affect the average charge per package.</p>

	<p><a href = 'https://drive.google.com/open?id=19hIad9pWu7xWWoaj4c6Xd_zM9u2LgpYR'> Here </a> is a link to the latest UPS contract, for reference, and below are our current incentive bands

<!-- AVG CHARGE PER PACKAGE -->

	<h2> Avg Charge per UPS Package </h2>
	<p> {{ domestic_avg_charge_per_package }} <br> {{ international_avg_charge_per_package }} </p>

<!-- ADDENDUM -->
<!--
	<p> The most likely reason for the increase in domestic is that UPS recently increased their rates, as explained <a href = 'https://www.ups.com/us/en/shipping/rates-update.page'>here</a> and <a href = 'https://www.ups.com/assets/resources/media/en_US/2019-UPS-Accessorial-Package-Rate-Change.pdf'>here</a>. To see how these rates will affect Adafruit, see this report <a href = 'https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CgVCDJFBqp2RHeDyfHj7ZNrsBE1rKUpERocOYPQXP-U/edit?usp=sharing'>here</a>, and watch for the follow-up report, estimates vs actual, due out in a few weeks.</p>
