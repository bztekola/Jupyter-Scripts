    <h6> Created {{ now }} </h6>

<!-- PURPOSE -->
	
	<h2> Purpose </h2>
	<p> The purpose of this weekly audit is to closely monitor our shipping profit over the most recent three weeks. For this entire report we exclude AdaBox shipments and Free Shipping. </p>

<!-- CSV DATA -->

	<h2> CSV Data </h2>
	<p> See <a href = {{data_link}} > here </a> to find this report's data in CSV form, where the worksheets go like this: </p>
	<ul style = 'list-style-type: circle'>
	  <li>All Data: All shipping data considered in this report</li>
	  <li>DHL No DDP: Where DHL charged DDP, but we did not</li>
	  <li>DHL Not Enough DDP: Where our DDP is less than DHL's</li>
	  <Li>DHL Not Enough Service: Where our service charge is less than DHL’s (a “service charge” being all charges excluding DDP)</Li>
	</ul>

<!-- SHIPPING PROFIT -->

	<h2> Shipping Profit </h2>
	<p class = 'subheader' > *Includes all orders whether or not they incurred a shipping profit loss. </p>
	<p class = 'subheader' > †”Missing as a %...” column shows the percentage of orders that are excluded because we do not yet have billing data for them. </p>
	<p> {{ by_week_recent_totals }} </p>
	<p> {{ by_week_recent_table }} </p>

<!-- DHL LOSSES -->	

	<h2 style = 'page-break-before: always' > DHL Losses </h2>
	<p class = 'subheader'> *Includes only DHL orders which incurred a shipping profit loss. </p>
	<p> {{ dhl_losses_table }} </p>

<!-- CONFIDENCE INTERVALS -->

	<h2> 95% Confidence Interval </h2>
	<p class = 'subheader'> *For avg weekly UPS and DHL shipping profit. </p>
	<p> {{ confidence_interval_table }} </p>
	<p> Because our target is no less than -$500 in shipping profit per week (UPS and DHL combined), we should pay attention to this when the lower value drops below -$500. </p>
