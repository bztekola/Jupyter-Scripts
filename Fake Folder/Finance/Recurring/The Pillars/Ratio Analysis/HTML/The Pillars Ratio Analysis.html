		<h3> Profitability Metrics </h3>
		<hr>
		<p>
			<b>Gross Profit:</b>
			<br>net sales - cost of goods sold, where net sales = total revenue - returns, allowances, discounts
			<br>This metric shows the costs associated with selling our goods.
			
			<br><br>

			<b>Gross Profit Margin:</b>
			<br>gross profit / net sales
			<br>Gross profit as a % of sales, not including labor or other costs like rent.

			<br><br>

			<b>Net Profit:</b>
			<br>net sales - all operating expenses
			<br>aka "the bottom line"; this is overall profit.

			<br><br>

			<b>Net Profit Margin:</b>
			<br>net profit / net sales
			<br>Overall profit as a % of sales, including all expenses. This metric shows our profitability.

			<br><br>

			<b>Operating Margin:</b>
			<br>operating income / net sales, where operating income = sales revenue - all operating expenses
			<br>This metric shows how much of each dollar of revenue is left over after both cost of goods sold and operating expenses are considered.

			<br><br>

			<b>ROA:</b>
			<br>net profit / total assets
			<br>aka "return on assets"; this metric shows how much profit is generated from every $1.00 of assets, where an asset is cash, equipment, and inventory. A small return indicates that we are underutilizing our assets.

			<br><br>
			<b>ROCE:</b>
			<br>operating income / (total assets - current liabilities)
			<br>aka "return on capital employed"; this metric shows the amount of income as a % of capital, where capital is the difference between assets and liabilities. A negative return indicates more liabilities than assets. A current liability is credit debt.

		<h3> Activity Metrics </h3>
		<hr>
		<p>
			<b>Turnover:</b>
			<br>How many times during the current period that said category is depleted and renewed. 

			<br><br>

			<b>Days to Turn:</b>
			<br>How many days it takes to turn said category, or more precisely: days in period / turnover. This metric is more intuitive than turnover.

			<br><br>

			<b>Receivables Turnover:</b>
			<br>(amount billed - amount refunded) / avg payment amount received
			<br>A small turnover means it takes longer to collect on our debts, while a large turnover means we collect quickly; we would like our turnover in days to be at most 30 days.

			<br><br>

			<b>Payables Turnover</b>
			<br>po total / avg po total
			<br>A small turnover means we take longer to pay our debts, while a large turnover means we pay regularly and frequently. This metric is a good indicator of how well we are able to pay our debts, and it can help new vendors decide if we are a risky company with which to do business.

			<br><br>

			<b>Inventory Turnover</b>
			<br>cost of goods sold / avg cost of inventory
			<br>A small turnover means we have much more stock than we need, while a large turnover means we order more frequently than is necessary. Since we strive to keep 90 days of stock on hand at any given time, a healthy turnover in days should be close to 90 days.

		<h3 > Liquidity Metrics </h3>
		<hr>
		<p>
			<b>Debt Ratio</b>
			<br>total liabilities / total assets
			<br>For each $1.00 in assets, this is how many liabilities we have, where an asset includes cash, equipment, and inventory, and our liabilities are mainly credit debt. A small ratio indicates we have much more in assets than in debt.

			<br><br>

			<b>Current Ratio</b>
			<br> current assets / current liabilities
			<br> For us, current liabilities equal total liabilities because we don't have any long term debt. Current assets include cash, credit owed to us, and inventory, but do not include equipment or depreciation. This metric shows how much we have in assets per $1.00 of liabilities. A large ratio means we have much more in assets than we do in debt.

			<br><br>

			<b>Operating Cash Flow</b>
			<br>(net profit + depreciation)/liabilities
			<br>Recall that net profit = net sales - all operating expenses. This metric is a measure of how well our cash flow covers our debt. Because depreciation is calculated at the year's end while net profit is done per period (month vs quarter), we use the average depreciation per period.

			<br><br>

			<b>Cash Conversion Cycle</b>
			<br>days inventory outstanding + days sales outstanding - days payable outstanding
			<br>The time (in days) it takes to convert inventory and other resources into cash from sales.
