<!-- PURPOSE -->
	
	<h2> Purpose </h2>
	<p> The purpose of this brief report is to recap income and expenses for the current {{ period2 }}, along with any expenses which exceed their typical range, and thus should be isolated and investigated. </p>

<!-- SUMMARIES -->	
	
	<h2> Summaries </h2>
	<p> {{ summary1 }} </p>
	<p> {{ summary2 }} </p>

<!-- CATEGORIES IN-DEPTH -->

	<h2 style = 'page-break-before: always' > Categories In-Depth </h2>
	<p> To get a sense of whether some category's value is "normal", "low", or "high" for the given period, we can isolate each category and use historical data to construct a trendline and confidence interval, which we can then compare with the current value of that category.</p>

	<p> When we do this, we produce the table below. </p>
	<p>  {{ linear_regression_results }}  </p>
