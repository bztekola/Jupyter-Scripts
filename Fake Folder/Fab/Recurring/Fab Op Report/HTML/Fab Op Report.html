	<h1> Fab Op Report<br>For week ending Thursday, {{ week_end }} </h1>
	<h6> Created {{ now }} </h6>
	
<!-- PURPOSE -->

	<h2> Purpose </h2>
	<p> The purpose of this weekly write-up is to report the Fab Op Metric, a single number that encapsulates the most important areas of Adafruit’s manufacturing division; that is, work order scheduling, quality, rework success rate, and in-stock percentage. The Fab Op Metric is inspired by the well-known <a href = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overall_equipment_effectiveness'> Overall Equipment Effectiveness Metric. </a> </p>

<!-- WEEKLY FAB OP METRIC CHART -->	

	<h2> Weekly Fab Op Metric </h2>
	<p class = 'subheader' >*A week begins on Friday and ends on Thursday. All of the averages in this report are taken over the last 53 weeks (so about one year).</p>
	<p> {{ summary_fab_op_metric_table }} </p>
	<p> Keep scrolling for a bird’s-eye-view of these metrics over time. </p>

<!-- QUALITY -->	

	<h2 style = 'page-break-before: always' > Quality </h2>
	<p class = 'subheader' > *Quality = Good Units / Total Units <br> †Measured over all steps, not just the Fabrication step </p>

<!-- REWORK -->		

	<h2 style = 'page-break-before: always' > Reworks </h2>
	<p class = 'subheader' > *Reworks = Successful Reworks / Total Reworks Attempted </p>
	<p> {{ rework_summary_write }} </p>
	<p> To see all reworks for the current week ending, check out the workbook link at the top of this report, and navigate to the "Current Reworks" worksheet. Below we have a chart showing the count of reworks over time along with the Rework Metric. </p>

<!-- IN-STOCK -->

	<h2 style = 'margin-bottom: -5px' > In-Stock </h2>
	<p class = 'subheader' > *Visible in-stock percentage of all currently working skus that have a bom type equal to “pnp”. </p>
	<p> The unique sku count is currently x{{ unique_sku_count }}. To see the skus which are used in this metric, check out the workbook link at the top of this report, and navigate to the worksheet titled "Skus Used For In-Stock Metric". </p>

	<p> Note that if you compare this metric to the one found in the <a href = 'https://volcano.adafruit.com/volcano/ada_plm.php?/Reports/ZeroStock/Fab'>Zero Stock Report</a>, the two may not match. This is because the Zero Stock Report shows a snapshot while the report shows over time.</p>

<!-- ELAPSED TIMES FOR WORK ORDERS -->		
	
	<h2 style = 'page-break-before: always' > Elapsed Times For Work Orders </h2>
	<p> This section contains a standalone set of metrics which are not included in the calculation of the Fab Op Metric. The table below shows the average time in days that it takes for a single work order to go from period to period. </p>
