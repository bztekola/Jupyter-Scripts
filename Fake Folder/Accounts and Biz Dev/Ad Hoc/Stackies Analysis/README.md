This project answers this questions posed by Phil:

hi hi,

here is one that has been on my list...

for products that have the "stackies" we add to the product page (things that can also be added) it would be good to know of those, which ones have the most "adds" and how many/what those are...

for example:
        https://www.adafruit.com/product/4191

how many customers click the stacky "Also include 1 x Alkaline AAA batteries - 2 pack ($0.95)"
