<!-- PURPOSE -->

	<h2> Purpose </h2>
	<p>This weekly report monitors the UPS gross transportation charge, as well as the average cost per UPS package. The gross transportation charge is a value that determines the level of savings which UPS offers to Adafruit, so any changes in this value will affect the average charge per package.</p>
